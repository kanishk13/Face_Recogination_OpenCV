# Face_Recogination_OpenCV

#Recognise Face using Classification Algorithm -KNN 

# 1.Load Training data (numpy array of all the persons )
	# x-values are stored in the numpy arrays 
	# y-values we need to assign for each person 

# 2.Read A Video Stream using OpenCV
# 3.Extract faces out of it
# 4. use knn to find the prediction to face (int)
# 5.map to predicit id to the name of the user 
# 6. Display the predicitions on the screen - bounding box and name
